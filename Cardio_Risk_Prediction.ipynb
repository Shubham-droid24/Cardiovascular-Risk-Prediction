        "\n",
        "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and a major public health concern. Therefore, its risk assessment is crucial to many existing treatment guidelines. Risk estimates are also being used to predict the magnitude of future cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity at the population level and in specific subgroups to inform policymakers and health authorities about these risks. Additionally, risk prediction inspires individuals to change their lifestyle and behaviour and to adhere to medications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project involves solving a real-world medical problem of predicting coronary heart disease for a patient in future and building up machine learning models for the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "I have summarized the project in 4 steps that how the flow of the project goes:-\n",
        "\n",
        "**First,** I understood the Cardiovascular risk dataset in which we are provided with patients information from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. I understood all the variables and how they can be important to the target variable i.e Ten Year CHD.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Second,** From Heart Rate column and BMI coumn(numerical), created new columns named Heart Rate Label and BMI Label which classify the Heart Rate as Low, Normal or High and the BMI as Underweight, Healthyweight, Overweight or Obese respectively in order to use them for visualization purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "In visualization, I started from univariate analysis to bivariate and multivariate analysis and in every visualization comparing TenYearCHD with other variables in order to understand the relation and impact or importance of them.\n",
        "From the visualization, I defined and tested three hypothesis and rejected all of them as p-value was less than significance level.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Third,** I have done preprocessing which is important before model implementation. In this, I handled missing values and treated outliers\n",
        ", encoding the categorical variables, some feature engineering selection done on the basis of correlation to create new features and remove old ones. \n",
        "\n",
        "After having selection of important features I transformed some of them, done data splitting and feature scaling. All these were important to be done as they create a great impact on the model performance.     \n",
        "\n",
        "**Last,** I build different models and predicted whether patient is at risk of Ten Year CHD or not and compared the results of different models developed. Also, I found the most important features required to predict patient is at risk of Ten Year CHD.\n",
